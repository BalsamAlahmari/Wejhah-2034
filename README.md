# Wejhah – وجهة  
**Smart Navigation & AR Experience for Sports Stadiums**

**Wejhah** is a smart mobile application that enhances the fan experience inside sports stadiums using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies.

The app allows fans to easily navigate within the stadium through a 3D interactive map. It uses advanced technologies such as YOLO for location detection and the A* algorithm to find the shortest paths to various destinations within the venue.

For a seamless AR experience, Wejhah integrates SLAM along with ARCore (Android) and ARKit (iOS). Additionally, a built-in AI chatbot is available to assist fans by answering their questions during events.
